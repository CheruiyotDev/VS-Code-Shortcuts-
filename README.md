# VS Code Shortcuts.
## 1. Opening and closing sidebar

The sidebar on VS code can be opened and closed without clicking on the left-hand side tab using the following VS shortcuts.

    Mac — Command + B

    Windows — Ctrl + B

    Ubuntu — Ctrl + B

Closing the sidebar is very useful when you are in the split editor mode.

## 2. Select word
This is used to select the word where your cursor currently is in VS code studio.

    Mac — Command + D

    Windows — Ctrl + D

    Ubuntu — Ctrl + D

If you keep pressing the shortcut more than once, you can keep selecting the same occurrence of the word.
## 3. Split Editor
A split editor (a side-by-side editor) is often useful if you need to compare two files or refer to another file while making changes to a different file in Visual Code Studio.

    Mac — Command + \ or 2,3,4

    Windows — Shift + Alt + \ or 2,3,4

    Ubuntu — Shift + Alt + \ or 2,3,4
